Previous Updates
		
Update 10:
• The issue stems from a Microsoft-pushed extension causing problems, awaiting further updates from Microsoft. These extensions serve functions like monitoring and replication, with some managed by Microsoft at the fabric level. 
• The team needs to scan around 16,000 to 17,000 VMs to identify the problematic extensions and is requesting a script from Microsoft for help. However, this won't fix machines already down, which were removed from the domain after a reboot. The priority is to prevent new machines from facing this issue
• The team has successfully tested removing the extension and rebooting VMs.
